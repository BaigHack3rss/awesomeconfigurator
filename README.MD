# Awesome WM Customization GUI Application

Hey everyone,

I've been trying to customize Awesome WM and I'm having some trouble with Lua. I've looked around for guides, but I haven't found anything that really helps me. So, I decided to make a GUI application to help with customization. Here are the features I want to include:

- Allow the user to make custom widgets for the wibar
- Allow the user to generate custom themes
- Allow the user customize keyboard shortcuts and mouse bindings
- Allow the user to define their auto start apps
- Allow the user to define window rules
- Allow the user to enable/disable layouts
- Allow the user to import custom modules like bling, layout-machi etc

As it currently stands not all the features would be coming when the app is released since it would be too time consuming and might take forever.

If you guys would like to help then you can contact me on discord: BaigGam3rss#8761. Make sure you are well acquainted with the following:

- Java and JavaFX
- Git and GitHub
- Lua in respect to Awesome WM
- Basic scripting in Bash or Python

If anyone has any tips or resources that could help me with this project, I would really appreciate it! Thanks in advance.
